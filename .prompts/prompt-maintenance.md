---

## Annual Deep Review

Once per year (recommended: January), perform a comprehensive audit:

### 1. Code Example Validation

- [ ] Test all code examples against latest versions
- [ ] Verify workflow examples execute successfully
- [ ] Check that Firebase configurations are valid
- [ ] Update any broken examples

### 2. Prompt File Organization

- [ ] Review CLAUDE.md decision framework
- [ ] Ensure prompt files are logically organized
- [ ] Identify missing guidance areas
- [ ] Consider new prompt files if needed

### 3. Technology Stack Review

- [ ] Evaluate if recommended stack is still optimal
- [ ] Consider emerging technologies worth adopting
- [ ] Review "boring technology" choices for continued validity
- [ ] Files to check: `platform-simplification.md`

### 4. Accessibility & Compliance

- [ ] Review accessibility standards (WCAG updates)
- [ ] Check compliance requirements
- [ ] Update a11y guidance if needed
- [ ] Files to check: `testing-qa.md`, accessibility prompts

## Version-Specific Reference Format

When documenting version-specific features, use this format:

```markdown
## Feature Name

> **Last Updated:** 2025-01-08
> **Technology Version:** Firebase SDK v10+, Node 20 LTS
> **Status:** Current

[Feature documentation here]

### Version Compatibility
- Firebase SDK: v10.0.0+
- Node.js: 18 LTS or higher (20 LTS recommended)
- Last verified: 2025-01-08
```

---

## Tracking Changes in Prompts

When updating prompt files:

1. **Add update metadata** at the top of modified sections:
   ```markdown
   > **Last Updated:** 2025-01-08 | **Reason:** Updated to service account auth
   ```

2. **Document deprecated patterns** instead of deleting them:
   ```markdown
   ### ⚠️ Deprecated Approach (Do Not Use)
   ```bash
   # ❌ Old way - deprecated
   ```

3. **Reference official documentation:**
   ```markdown
   See: https://firebase.google.com/docs/...
   ```

4. **Test before committing:**
   - Verify code examples work
   - Check links aren't broken
   - Ensure consistency across related prompts

5. **Update CLAUDE.md if needed:**
   - Add new prompt files to decision framework
   - Update guidance references
   - Maintain decision map accuracy

## Automation Opportunities

Consider implementing:

### 1. Dependabot for GitHub Actions
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"
```

### 2. Link Checker GitHub Action
```yaml
# .github/workflows/link-checker.yml
name: Check Links
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 1 * *'  # Monthly
jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: lycheeverse/lychee-action@v1
        with:
          args: --verbose '.prompts/**/*.md'
```

### 3. Calendar Reminders
- Set quarterly calendar events for prompt review
- Assign responsibility to team member
- Track review completion

## Common Deprecation Patterns to Watch

### Firebase
- **CLI tokens** → Service accounts ✅ (Fixed 2025-01-08)
- **Compat SDK** → Modular SDK (monitor for v8 end-of-life)
- **Legacy database** → Firestore (ongoing transition)

### GitHub Actions
- **set-output** → GITHUB_OUTPUT (deprecated 2022, removed 2023)
- **save-state** → GITHUB_STATE (deprecated 2022)
- **Personal access tokens** → Fine-grained tokens or OIDC

### Node.js
- Node 18 → End of life (2025-04-30) ⚠️ **PAST EOL**
- Node 20 → LTS (until 2026-04-30)
- Node 22 → LTS (until 2027-04-30)
- Node 24 → **Current LTS** "Krypton" (Active until 2028-04-30)

- For breaking changes, plan migration strategy
- Document decisions in architectural decision records (ADRs)

---

## Emergency Updates

For critical issues (security vulnerabilities, breaking changes):

1. **Immediate Action:**
   - Update affected prompts immediately
   - Add warning banners to deprecated sections
   - Notify team via Slack/Discord

2. **Communication:**
